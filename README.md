Malware Detection in Android [Machine Learning - 2017]
=======

This is a project for Machine Learning course of Master's degree, Engineering in Computer Science.

The Android platform provides several information about the applications' behavior through the feature sets. Roughly speaking, they describe not only the permissions that a specific application has or the hardware component that it will use but also all the calls to different APIs and the network addresses used from the application during its execution.
Malware analysis task is based on the Drebin dataset; a huge dataset that allows to focus entirely
on the design choices of the machine learning method - instead of gathering the core information from the applications, that Drebin already provides in a precise format.

Our goal is simple: given an apk, classify it as malware or not (malware detection).
